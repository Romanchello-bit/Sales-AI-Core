# Sales AI Core & Evolution Hub

This is an AI-powered platform for simulating, analyzing, and evolving sales strategies. The main feature is the **Evolution Hub**, where AI agents (sales scenarios) compete and improve over generations.

## 🚀 Live Demo

The application is configured to launch directly into the **Evolution Hub**, the core feature of this project.

## Features

- **⚔️ Evolution Hub (Default):** The main interface to run sales simulations, view leaderboards of AI agents, and trigger evolution cycles to create new, improved sales scenarios.
- **🤖 Sales Bot CRM:** An interactive chat interface to manually test sales scripts or conduct simulated sales calls.
- **🧪 Math Lab:** A computational environment for graph theory experiments and algorithm benchmarking.

## How to Use

1.  **Provide API Key:** Enter your Google API Key in the sidebar to enable all AI features.
2.  **Explore Evolution Hub:**
    - Click **"Run Simulations"** to gather data on how existing scenarios perform.
    - View the **"Leaderboard"** to see which AI agents are most effective.
    - Use the **"Scenario Inspector"** to analyze the structure and performance of any agent.
    - Click **"Run Evolution Cycle"** to create a new generation of agents based on the simulation data.
3.  **Switch Modes:** Use the sidebar to switch to the "Sales Bot CRM" or "Math Lab" for other functionalities.
